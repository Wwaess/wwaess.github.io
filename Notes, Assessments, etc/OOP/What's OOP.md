# What is OOP?

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses "objects" to design software. It is based on several key concepts: 

1. **Classes and Objects**: A class is a blueprint for creating objects. An object is an instance of a class that contains data and methods to manipulate that data.

2. **Encapsulation**: This principle restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which can prevent the accidental modification of data. It is typically achieved through access modifiers like private, protected, and public.

3. **Inheritance**: This allows a new class (subclass) to inherit properties and behaviors (methods) from an existing class (superclass). It promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.

4. **Polymorphism**: This allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon, even if they share the same name. It can be achieved through method overriding (runtime polymorphism) and method overloading (compile-time polymorphism).

5. **Abstraction**: This principle focuses on hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object. It helps in reducing complexity and increases efficiency.

OOP is widely used in software development due to its ability to model real-world entities, promote code reusability, and improve maintainability. Popular OOP languages include Java, C++, Python, and Ruby.
