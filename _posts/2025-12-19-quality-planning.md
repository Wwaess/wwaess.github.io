# Notes about Quality Management

A *quality metric* is a quantitative measure of whether a product has a given quality _attribute_. 

The cost to maintain a system due to suboptimal quality, e.g. because the "done" definition has been changed due to updates to design specifications, is known as *technical debt*. 

Ideally these metrics should be agreed with the customer when the request for a product is made. Because the customer may not have the technical background for the product a priori, it is important that these metrics be defined as unambiguously as possible, with clear markers for whether they've been met. 

The **ISO/IEC 25010 (2011)** lists 8 quality characteristics: 

- Functional suitability: 
    Does it do the job it's meant to do?
- Performance efficiency:
    How well does it use its resources?
- Compatibility: 
    Can it co-exist with other systems?
- Usability: 
    How easy can people use it?
- Reliability: 
    Does it keep working?
- Security: 
    Is it protected?
- Maintainability: 
    How easy can it be fixed, should problems arise?
- Portability: 
    Can it be moved between environments? 


To get an output that achieves the agreed metrics, you should define a *quality management plan*. 

A project should consider two core phases: 
- **Quality Assurance**: 
    This is about ensuring that the method with which you build a product is sound so that quality-facing roadblocks are kept to a minimum. (-proactive) 
- **System Testing**: 
    This is about checking the product itself, to detect whether any quality defects are present in the product. (-reactive)

**Quality control** is a more general version of system testing, i.e. system testing is a PART of QC. It's taking corrective action when the project strays from the plan.
