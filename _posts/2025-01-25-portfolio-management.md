# Upating portfolios

I keep forgetting I even have to update this, which is a bit of an issue. 

This coupled with a recent PC upgrade has meant that the git commands and stuff I use to push these updates onto my portfolio - which I still don't understand; I still feel like I'm executing code blindly just to do them - don't work. I suspect I'm missing some software that I haven't properly installed, or a PATH file's not being properly read. Either way - I've resorted (rather late) to go to my old PC files and see what I can push here. 

I've mentioned before in [Starting a Porfolio] that I tend to keep my notes locally on my computer. In particular I take notes using Obsidian.md, which is very helpful in allowing me to format my notes in a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) format, while also allowing me to cross-reference them in a non-linear fashion. 

One ideal way then to handle my portfolio at the same time would be to publish _directly_ from Obsidian. But a lot of softwares I've found that would allow me to do that are paid and/or have some login requirements and stuff that make me really uncomfortable. I've already expressed my concern about "oversharing" information online before, and if at all possible I want to keep that to a minimum. 

Suffice it to say, while I migrate _some_ of my files onto the portfolio, be forewarned there may yet be gaps here and there; I'm not even sure at this point whether I'll get to a point where I can tell myself, "Yeah, this site is fully updated!" - not a good feeling at all.
