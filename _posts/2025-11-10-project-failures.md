**DISCUSSION 1**
# Project Failures Study

## __"What do you believe are the three most common reasons for project failure?"__

Agrawal, Walia and Anu's paper on the "_Development of a Software Design Error Taxonomy_" (2024) seeks to explore how software developers interact with each other during the design stage of software development. It posits these reasons for project failure, or at least project setback, occurring: 

- **High cognitive loads** - too much information
Having too much information be given at once is too much to process; designers can easily either misunderstand the requirements or miss out some of them altogether as a result. Included in this is communication breakdowns arisen as a result of this overload, such as 

- **A lack of knowledge** - too little information 
Designers and engineers may not understand the problem fully, or misjudge the context of the problem being addressed, leading to flawed assumptions. This results in design choices that don't actually fit with the environment where the system will be used.

- **Organisational issues**
Issues such as unclear workflows, missing documentation and rushed timelines are major obstacles in the development cycle. Even if the designers are skilled, errors such as these which may not get noticed early on can escalate further along in development. 


## __"Give two examples of failures that support your choices."__

For *a lack of knowledge*, in 1999, the Mars Climate Orbiter had been travelling for 10 months on its way to Mars, but when it reached Mars's atmosphere, instead of approaching its planned elevation of 226 km above the planet's surface, it reached its lowest point of orbit of 57 km before burning up, due to a conversion error in units (pounds-force vs. newtons) for the spacecraft's thrust forces (Harish, 2025) (NASA, 199). 

For *organisational issues*, the United States Federal Aviation Administration (US FAA) wanted to modernise its air traffic control system between 1982 and 1994, but had major organisation faults - the budget "ballooned to $7.6 billion", an increase of over 200%; and of the 2.6 billion dollars that had been spent by 1994, the project being scrapped meant that over a billion dollars' worth of computers and software had to be thrown away (Shuster, 2017).
