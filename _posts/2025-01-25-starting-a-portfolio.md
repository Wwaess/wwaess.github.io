# Starting an e-portfolio

I'm currently transitioning from a maths background to computer science by undertaking an MSc, and during this induction module one thing we've been encouraged to do is set up and maintain an e-portfolio - the idea, I'm told, being that it's a space to record reflections, showcase what we've learnt and build a digital presence while moving through the course.

This is both really new and really worrisome for me. 

For one, I'm from a maths background. Maths degrees don't require you to submit online group projects or anything like that, so I've no clue what to add in posts. What I'm likely going to end up doing is summarising things I've learnt every now and then, just so that there is something of note on this site. 

For two, and this is the bigger thing for me personally, I'm rather young - this has meant that I've spent the vast majority of my school years being told specifically to be careful what I post online. It's why I don't have a lot of social media accounts, and the ones I do have I specifically limit them as far as possible: keeping visibility settings to a minimum, not posting things all the time (like I have seen some of my friends' wont [habit] to do), and not just exposing my personal details online. 

So being asked to make something deliberately public-facing - even if it's academic - is quite daunting, and almost against the safety protocols I'm used to about putting things online. I can see the value here: this allows me to keep a record of what progress I make over the course of my degree. In practice this is a little more like publishing my notes that I would have made locally on my computer, whereby the idea is to be more deliberate in how I present them for anyone who might be reading (anyone who isn't me, that is). 

So I guess this is more like a highlights reel?
