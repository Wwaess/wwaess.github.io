# What is an SDLC?

A **software development life cycle (SDLC)** refers to a process used by development teams when designing and building software of a high quality [^1]. 

While these vary from team to team, they can generally be outlined in 6 steps [^1]: 
- **Plan** - deduce costs, timeframes, resource management and work allocation. This typically involves making a dedicated document. 
- **Design** - analyse requirements and determine a solution to create the desired software, along with how best to integrate it with whatever software the client organisation already uses. 
- **Implement** - write the code. 
- **Test** - check the software for bugs, either manually or by automating tests. If there are many teams working on the code, this often happens in tandem with the implementation phase. 
- **Deploy** - 
- **Maintain** -
