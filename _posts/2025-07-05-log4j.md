# log4j - the Pros and Cons of Logging
-# collaborative discussion

In cybersecurity, logging refers to the process of recording events and actions within a system such as a network. In theory, logs can be used for security analysis, to track system changes or unusual behaviour indicative of threats or breaches - which allows analysts to investigate and respond to security incidence and support efforts related to audits and legal compliance. 

However, if not managed correctly - or even if they are - logging softwares may still be susceptible to exploitation. Berger (2023) explores the vulnerabilities in Log4Shell discovered in 2021, an exploit found in the Log4j 2 Java library which has been implemented in several large global servers, such as those used by Minecraft, Amazon Web Services and VMware. This exploit featured several vulnerabilities, including code injection and DoS attacks with self-referential look-ups. 

Ideally, should an organisation seek to monitor their systems via logs - and it is generally advised that they do (NCSC, 2025; Sharif, 2022) - extra checks must be put in place so as to minimise exploitations like these.
