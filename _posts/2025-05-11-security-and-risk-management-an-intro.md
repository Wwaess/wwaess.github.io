# Security and Risk Management - an intro

Information assets, per the National Security Agency and the US Dept. of Homeland Security, need to be:
- confidential
    - Sensitive details need to be kept secure (i.e. accessible only to the relevant people)
- integrous
    - The information collected needs to be true and trusted
- available
    - The information needs to be readily retrievable
The above is called the CIA triad.

Risk is loosely defined, but roughly refers to the probability of an event occurring that could reduce a business’s value. It’s often directly tied to the loss of at least one of confidentiality, integrity and availability of certain information assets.

# Systems to consider
There are 5 components to an organisation:

- strategy – supplies tasks and objectives
- intel – people’s efforts, behaviours and knowledge
- tech – materials and equipment
- structure – supplies formal procedures
- management – supplies, monitors and drives the attainment of goals

Any system managing the info. sec. of these components must adhere to the PDCA mandate:

- plan – make a plan, incl. any new procedures, roles and modified responsibilities
- do – enforce the plan / review its enforcement (inc. necessary risk checks)
- check – gather and review comments on the plans
- act – modify procedures, roles and responsibilities

# Risk Identification
Assessments are either qualitative (subjective, non-numerical) or qualitative (statistical, historical data). Ideally, using these one should enumerate risk values, then determine whether to

- eliminate – remove/avoid the risk
- tolerate – record the risk but leave it alone (cost-benefit reasons)
- reduce – minimise the impact of the risk
- transfer – share the risk impact / cost of mitigation among multiple stakeholders
One can mitigate risks either physically, procedurally or technically.

RISK = Threat x Vulnerability x Asset
